I've wanted to create my own blog for a little while now, but finding the motivation to actually get it set up was always difficult. What tipped the scale for me was when I realized I could use a blog like this instead of GitHub Gists to post my guides/tutorials. 

I've used gists in the past to create guides for my students as a TA, and they've always worked well for that. However, I've always found that the UX isn't quite as nice for viewers. So, once the idea for a blog came to mind it seemed like a no-brainer to start one. I'll be migrating my gists to here at some point in the future!

I don't expect to be updating this blog too much, however I'm hoping that over the years I can provide some value to anyone who happens to come across it :)
